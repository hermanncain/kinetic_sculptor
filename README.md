An simple tool helping you make your own kinetic sculptures.

The most famous kinetic sculpture is the cauldron of 2016 Brazil Olympic Games designed by [Anthony Howe](https://www.howeart.net/). I studied his works and made this simple tool to generate kinetic sculptures like/beyond them.

This repository also includes some codes of **layout tree & grammar**, as well as the **layout synthesis algorithm** on the basis of *dynamic string kernel*. Note that there is no interfaces for them in this repository.
